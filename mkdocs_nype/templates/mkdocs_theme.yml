# Supported settings (as of 0.5.0):
# - `js` dict(str, Any) - values will be passed on to JavaScript.
# - `old_prefix` str - for 404 page, old prefix to redirect old links from if not found
# - `container_css` str - (white)space separated names of `nype-{name}` CSS style classes that will influence the container.
#    container_css: 'hide-h1 content-only'
# - `{key}` {value} - any key with any value, though deep dictionaries will likely not be recursively added.

#
# Additionally to global overrides pages can include:
# - `js_include` list(str) - (white)space separated names of `non-js` keys that will be passed on to the `js` too.
